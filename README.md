## Introduction
This repository contains the code for the visualization project we did as an assignment for class. The goal of this project was to create different visualizations for certain data sets. I worked with the diamonds data set, the Palmer penguin data set, and the baby names data set. For this assignment I worked with myself, creating visualizations that would most effectively display the data. 
## Implementation 
In this project, I loaded the data into R. Then I made sure the data was clean and tidy before I created my visualizations. Then I created facteted scatter plots, regular scatter plots, and a line graph to analyze the data by using libraries such as ggplot. There were a few issues figuring out how to make the data clean and what ways to display the data without being overwhelming. 
##Conclusion 
For this project, I learned how to create data visuals for different types of data sets. I created a line graph and scatter plots which showed relationships to be analyzed. These results could be used to be applied to many useful ideas.
